In a company is building a notification system that needs to send updates to users through multiple channels (Email, SMS, Push Notifications, Slack, WhatsApp).
Requirements:
1. The system should be easily extendable â€“ tomorrow a new channel (e.g., Telegram) should be added **without changing the core code**.
2. Notifications can be **simple text**, or templated messages (with placeholders for username, order details, etc.).
3. Different customers want different combinations of channels (one wants Email+SMS, another wants only Push).
4. Some messages are urgent (should go via all channels instantly), while others are **informational** (only one channel is enough).
