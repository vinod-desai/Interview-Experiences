Round 1:
Create Tabs design component using any frontend framework ReactJS/Angular?
Write Clean and Maintainable production ready code.
Write Unit Tests.
Functionality:
Click on Tab, it should display it's content and include tabId in the url to retain selected tab when user refreshers the page.

Round 2:
How can we collect huge amounts of events data from UI and send it to backend API?
Time Based Approach -> Collect events over period of time (say 5 sec) and make the api call.
Event Size Threshold -> Wait for event threashold to reach max (EVENT_THRESHOLD = 500) events and make the api call.
Hybrid Approach -> Mix of time based collecting events and event threshold to send the data to backend.
How can we send the collected data if user closes the browser window/app.

Write clean, maintainable and production ready code.
Write unit tests.
